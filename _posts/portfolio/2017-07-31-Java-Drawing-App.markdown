This is my final project that I completed as part of my diploma in Java programming.
It is a fully object oriented GUI application that allows the user to interactively draw shapes. The user can choose from three shapes to draw. The application has buttons that allow the user to undo the last shape and to clear the entire frame. There is also a dropdown menu that allowd the user the chose the color of the shape and a dropdown list where the user can choose what type of shape they want to draw.
